# CS-210-Project-Three

# Project Summary
The Corner Grocer project involved developing an item-tracking program designed to analyze text records of items purchased throughout the day. The primary goal was to help the Corner Grocer optimize their produce section by identifying the frequency of items purchased. The program provides several functionalities, including searching for the frequency of specific items, displaying a list of all items with their frequencies, and generating a histogram to visually represent these frequencies. Additionally, the program creates a backup data file for record-keeping.

# What I Did Well
I successfully implemented a clear and user-friendly menu system that allows users to interact with the program easily. The modular design of the code ensured that each functionality was isolated in its own function or class method, making the code easier to manage and debug. I also used C++ Maps to efficiently handle the item-frequency pairs, which enhanced the performance of the program.

# Areas for Enhancement
One area where the code could be improved is in the handling of large input files. Currently, the program processes the input file sequentially, which works well for smaller datasets but could be optimized for larger files. Implementing more advanced data structures or algorithms to handle large datasets would improve the program's efficiency and scalability. Additionally, enhancing the user input validation would make the program more robust and user-friendly.

# Challenges and Solutions
The most challenging aspect of this project was designing the histogram feature, particularly ensuring that the histogram accurately represented the frequency of items with appropriate scaling. To overcome this, I iterated through several design choices and tested the output extensively. Using online resources and referencing C++ documentation helped me refine the logic and presentation of the histogram.

# Transferable Skills
The skills I developed in handling data structures like Maps, managing file I/O operations, and designing user-friendly interfaces are highly transferable to other projects. These skills will be particularly useful in any future projects that involve data analysis or require efficient data handling.

# Maintainability, Readability, and Adaptability
To ensure the program is maintainable and adaptable, I adhered to industry-standard best practices, including using clear and descriptive variable names, writing modular code, and including inline comments to explain the functionality of each section. This approach not only makes the code easier to understand but also allows for future modifications or extensions with minimal disruption to the existing codebase.
